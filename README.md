## Algorithm Visualizer

An algorithm visualizer is a tool or program that visually demonstrates how an algorithm works, typically using graphical elements such as bars, lines, or nodes to represent data structures or the steps involved in the algorithm. 
These visualizations are often used to explain and teach complex algorithms, particularly in fields such as sorting, searching, and graph traversal, by making their operations more understandable and intuitive.
